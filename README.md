# Home-Automation-using-an-Android-mobile

• In this project, we access different appliances with our mobile phone through internet using Wi-fi.

• The micro controller used was Raspberry Pi B+, with an OS Raspberry in it. 

• After installing the OS, the Micro controller acts as a CPU. 

• Raspberry Pi will act as a server & app in the mobile phone will act as a client.

• An Android application is developed using Android SDK, we will send commands by typing in the input field provided.

• It also works with voice based commands, which converts voice to text using Google Voice Recognition when connected to internet. This app sends the commands to the Raspberry Pi. In this way the device is controlled.

• The Android app made is installed on the mobile phone and we keep authenticating for a legitimate user. Once you successfully logged in, you can access the different appliances.
